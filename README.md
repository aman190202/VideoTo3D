# VideoTo3D
3D Reconstruction via Videos

## Ideas

1. Creating a voxel representation of each object that appears on the 
video via a single shot 3D construction and stitching these voxels 
together to create a spatial environment.

2. Using NeRF to do the same.

## Applications

1. Can be used later on as an add-on to ScanQA which uses VoteNet ( a 
Hough voting based object detector)
